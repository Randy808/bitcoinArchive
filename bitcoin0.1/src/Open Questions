How is mapAskFor populated?

Is mapRelay exclusively used to store any data that's not a block but needs to get sent to other nodes?

Where does the message made in RelayWalletTransaction get sent to other nodes?
-In 'SendMessages' the inventory queued for sending on each node is checked and sent.

What is the difference between setInventoryKnown and setInventoryKnown2?

Does this client ask for blocks when it comes online or does it have to be done explicitly?
-On connection, the sender and receiver (who makes the node in ThreadSocketHandler) both initialize a node which sends off a "version" message. Each node processes the version message by sending a "getblocks" message to each other.

Can this client just ask for the blocks/transactions just relevant to a single address?

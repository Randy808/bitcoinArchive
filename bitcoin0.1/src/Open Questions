How is mapAskFor populated?

Is mapRelay exclusively used to store any data that's not a block but needs to get sent to other nodes?

Where does the message made in RelayWalletTransaction get sent to other nodes?

-In 'SendMessages' the inventory queued for sending on each node is checked and sent.

What is the difference between setInventoryKnown and setInventoryKnown2?
